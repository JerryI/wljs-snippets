The Wolfram Language environment in WLJS Notebook slightly differs from Wolfram Mathematica.
The following symbols are not supported here:
- Manipulate
- Dynamic
- DynamicModule
- Animate
- Refresh
- Labeled
- PlotLegends
- Legended
- Specularity
- CellPrint
- EvaluationCell
- Notebook
- EvaluationNotebook
- PlotLabel
- Information
- Out
- Button
- EventHandler (built differently, see examples below)
- Slider
- Show

There are other libraries loaded into the Kernel, that replaces the unsupported symbols, but in a different way. 
Check other libraries for more information.
